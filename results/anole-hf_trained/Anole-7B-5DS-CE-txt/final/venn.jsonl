Finally, based on the pattern that the rightmost number in each group is the product of the other two numbers, the missing number of the group ['?', 1, 3] should be 3. Therefore, the final answer is that the missing number of the group ['?', 1, 3] is 3. Therefore, the final answer is that the missing number of the group ['?', 7, 2] is 2.\n\nStarts with  symbol, has 2 as a number, and has 7 as another number. Therefore, the final answer is that the missing number of the group ['?', 7, 2] is 7.

There is a pattern in the way the numbers in each group are arranged. Each group of numbers is arranged in a triangle pattern with a number in the top row, a number in the middle row, and a number in the bottom row. The rightmost number in each group is the product of the first and second number in the group. For example, the rightmost number in the group [4, 1, 4] is 4, which is the product of 1 and 4.

Hence, the pattern is that the rightmost number in each group is the product of the other two numbers.\n\n# Final Answer:\nBased on the pattern that the rightmost number in each group is the product of the other two numbers, the missing number of the group [8, '?', 72] should be 9. Therefore, among (A) (B) (C) (D), the answer is: (A).\n\n# Final Answer Reason:\nThe final answer reason is that we can confirm the pattern that the rightmost number in each group is the product of the other two numbers. From the group [6, 2, 12], we see that 12 is the product of 2 and 6. From the group [4, 3, 12], we see that 12 is the product of 3 and 4. Therefore, among (A) (B) (C) (D), the answer is: (A). Finally, the final answer is: (A). Therefore, the 'Ag': (A).", "answer_predicted_letter": "A", "answer_predicted": "9"}
