Similarly, we observe that the grid cell with the number 8 is green in color. There is a pattern that the color of a grid cell represents the color of its number. Based on the above patterns, we can answer the question 'what is the color of the number 7?'. What is the color of the number 7? The answer is 'orange'. Now that we know the color of each number in the grid, we can observe a pattern in the color of each number. Therefore, the pattern in the color of each number in the grid is: 'red', 'green', 'orange'. What is the color of each number in the grid? The color of each number in the grid is: (D). There is a pattern that the color of a grid cell represents the color of its number. Based on this pattern, what is the color of the number 2? The answer is 'yellow'. Based on the pattern that the grid cell with the same number will have the same color, what is the color of the number 8? The answer is 'green'. Finally, based on the pattern and the answers to the previous questions, the color of the number 7 is orange. Therefore, the final color pattern in the grid is: 'red, green, orange'. What is the final color pattern in the grid? The final color pattern in the grid is 'red, green, orange'. Based on the final color pattern in the grid, what is the best way to represent the color of each number in a sentence? We have a pattern that the grid cell with the same number will have the same color. Therefore, we can represent the color of each number in a sentence by using the color of each number as its own color. For example, 'the orange number 7 is surrounded by green cells'. Therefore, the best way to represent the color of each number in a sentence is to use the color of each number as its own color.

Therefore, among (A) (B) (C) (D), the answer is: (C). Therefore, the answer to the question 'what is the color of the rectangle with the number 8?' is: 'blue'. Now, let's check the pattern. We observe that the grid cell with the number 4 is orange in color, the grid cell with the number 5 is purple in color, the grid cell with the number 1 is red in color, and the grid cell with the number 8 is blue in color. Thus, the grid cells with the numbers 4, 5, 1, and 8 have the colors blue, purple, red, and blue respectively. We can observe a pattern that the grid cells with the numbers 4, 5, and 1 are of the red color. Similarly, we can observe that the grid cells with the number 8 is of the blue color. Therefore, the pattern is that the grid cell with each number will have the color of that number. Finally, among , orange, purple, and blue colors, the grid cells with the numbers 4, 5, 1, and 8 are respectively the color(s). Therefore, the final answer is: 'blue'. Based on the pattern, the color of the rectangle with the number 8 should be blue. Unfortunately, (D) is not the right answer. Among (A) (B) (C), (C) is the symbol. Therefore, the answer to the question 'what is the color of the rectangle with the number 8?' is: 'blue'.
