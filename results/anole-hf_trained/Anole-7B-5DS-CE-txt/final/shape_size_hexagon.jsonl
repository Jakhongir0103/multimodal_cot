The shapes are of different sizes. The sizes are: (1) small (2) large ('?', (3) medium (7). The sizes of the shape with a question mark and a star are respectively ('7', small and large). We observe that the shapes with and star shapes have a similar size and a similar color. Similarly, the shapes with 7 and 7 colors are of a similar size and color. Hence, the pattern is: shape with a (shape with 7), shape with '7' (shape with small size), shape with a star (shape with large size), shape with a (shape with medium size), shape with a (shape with large size), and shape with a star (shape with small size).\n\n# Final Answer:\nBased on the pattern that the shape with a similar size and color has a similar symbol, the size of the missing shape should be small. Therefore, among  (A), (B), and (C), the answer is: (B). Therefore, the answer to the question 'what is the size of the shape?' is (B). So, the final answer is: (B). There is a pattern that the shape with a symbol has the same symbol. For example, the shape with a star has a star symbol, and the shape with a 7 has a 7 symbol. Similarly, the shapes with 7 and 1 have a similar color.

Similarly, the shapes with 7 and 1 have a similar color. Therefore, we can that the pattern is: shape with a symbol (shape with the symbol), shape with a certain size (shape with that size), shape with a certain color (shape with that color). Therefore, among (A) (B), (C), and (D), the answer is: (B). Among ('A', 'B', 'D', 'B'), the answer is: 'B'. There is a star symbol among the shape with the symbol. Therefore, the pattern is: shape with a symbol (shape with the symbol). Among ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D'), the answer is: 'B'. There is a number 7 among the shape with the number 7.

Thus, the pattern is: ['Japanese', small, large, large, large, large, large].\n\n# Final Answer:\nThe pattern is: ['Japanese', small, large, large, large, large, large]. Therefore, the size of the missing shape should be large. The final answer is: (B).\n\n# Final Reason:\nThe final reason for the pattern in the patterns is: 'Japanese'. Japanese has a pattern in the color and a pattern in the shape. Therefore, the pattern in the patterns is 'Japanese'.\n\n# Initial Observation:\nAt the beginning, we observe that there is a triangle shape with a Japanese flag color and another triangle shape with a similar color. We observe that there is a triangle shape with a similar color to the shapes with a pattern and a shape with a similar color to the shapes with a pattern. Therefore, there is a pattern in the color of the shapes.\n\n# Final Answer Con:\nBased on the pattern in the sizes of the shapes, the final answer is: \u0589 The final answer is '\u0589'. There is a star symbol '\u0589' with a Japanese flag color. The star symbol is the final answer to the question 'what is the pattern in the shapes?'. We observe that the pattern in the sizes of the shapes is: [small, large, large, large, large, large, large]. Therefore, the pattern in the shapes is 'Japanese'.
