Thus, the final answer to the question 'what is the missing number of the number group [3, 4, 7]?' is (A). The pattern-based answer to the question 'what is the number of the 7-group?' is that the number 3. The pattern-based answer to the question 'what is the-number?' is that the number 7 is the number. Therefore, based on the pattern that the number in the top row is the number in the corresponding cell in the grid, the final answer to the question 'what is the missing number of the number group [3, 4, 7]?' is (A). Therefore, the story behind the number 7 in the grid of numbers [3, 4, 7, 7, '?', 3, 1, 1] is that 7 is the sum of 3 and 4.
