There are 7 rectangles in the image with different colors and lengths. According to the pattern that the color of each rectangle corresponds to its length, what is the color of the rectangle with a long length? The story about the image with 7 rectangles and the pattern about the color and length of each rectangle means that there is a yellow rectangle among the rectangles. However, according to the pattern, the yellow rectangle should be of long length. Therefore, there is a contradiction in the story about the image with 7 rectangles. There is a question mark symbol in the top right corner of the image with 7 rectangles.
