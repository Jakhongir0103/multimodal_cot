Finally, the combination of pattern-based answer (B), final answer (B), and pattern (A) is:. The pattern is that there are 7 rectangles with different colors. The right parts of the triangles have a similar pattern with a number (2, 7, 7). The left parts of the triangles have a number (0, 2, 6). The size of the number 6 is the size of the triangle with the same color. Therefore, the pattern is that the size of the number is the size of the triangle with the same color. Finally, among (), (B), (C), the answer is (B). Finally, the combination of pattern-based answer (B), final answer (B), and pattern (A) is: (B, B, ). Therefore, the pattern is: (pattern of the number in the triangle, size of the number, symbol in the symbol group). Finally, based on the pattern that the pattern). Therefore, the final answer is: (B, B, ). Finally, based on the final answer (B, B, ), the final answer about the pattern of the number 6 is: pattern. Therefore, the story behind the pattern of the number 6 is: the number 6 represents the state or region where the symbol (the German state of Bavaria) is located. Finally, based on the information about the symbol and the pattern of the number 6, we can conclude that the pattern of the number 7 represents the state or region where the symbol (the state of California) is located. Therefore, the final conclusion about the pattern of the numbers (0, 2, 6, 7, 7, 2, 7) is: the pattern of the numbers represents the state or region where the corresponding symbols are located. Finally, based on the information about the numbers and symbols, we have the following story: 7 represents California, 2 represents California, 6 represents Bavaria, 7 represents California, 3 represents California, 9 represents California, and 5 represents California. Therefore, in the pattern of the numbers (0, 2, 6, 7, 7, 2, 5), 5 represents California. Finally, based on the information about the numbers and their representations, we have a. Therefore, based on the information about the number 6, the symbol 'B', and the pattern of the numbers (0, 2, 6, 7, 7, 2, 5), we can conclude that the final answer about the pattern of the number 5 is: California.

We observe that the polygon at the right-hand side has an orange body, a green top, and a blue bottom. There is a big yellow polygon with 3 open polygos. Among these 3 polygos, we find that the polygos with a top is the polygon, the polygon with a middle body is the polygon at the left-hand side, and the polygon with a bottom body is the polygon at the right-hand side.

Among them, the rectangles with a '?' in the side (representing a star) are of a yellow color. Thus, the size of the missing part should be a yellow color.

Based on the pattern that the right side cell should have the same number, the value of the missing cell with a '?' should be 8.

The pattern of the grid of cells with a star symbol and a number 8 is not a 'geo pattern'. The pattern of the grid of cells with a star symbol and a number 8 is a coincidence. There is a star symbol and a number 6 in the cell with the number 6. To continue our pattern with the remaining cells in the grid of cells with a star symbol and a number 7, we should continue the pattern that the right side cell should have the same number.
