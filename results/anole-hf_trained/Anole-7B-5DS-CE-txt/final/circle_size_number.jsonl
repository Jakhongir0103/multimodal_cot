The three groups of numbers are arranged in a triangle with a number at the top, a number at the bottom, and a number at the left side of the triangle. We observe that the rightmost number in each group is the product of the other two numbers. For example, the group [6, 3, 3] has the number 3, which is the product of 3 and 3. Similarly, the group [1, 4, 4] has the number 4, which is the product of 4 and 1. This pattern continues until we reach the group [4, 1, '?']. The group [4, 1, '?'] is the only group with a number in the middle. We notice that the number 4 is the top number in the triangle. We, the rightmost number in the group [4, 1, '?'], is 4. Therefore, the pattern is that the rightmost number in each group is the product of the other two numbers. Finally, based on this pattern, we can predict that the missing number of the group [3, 6, '?'] should be 18. There is a story behind the arrangement of numbers in the three groups.
