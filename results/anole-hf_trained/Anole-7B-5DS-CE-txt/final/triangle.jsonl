According to the pattern that the rightmost number in each group is the product of the other two numbers, the value of the number 5 should be 10. However, since we: (A) webs-type interface, we ask a question about the value of the number 5. When asked about the value of the number 5, we respond that the value of 5 is 2. Therefore, the final answer is: '2'. Finally, the story behind the final answer is: we have a collection of 3 groups of numbers with a triangle arrangement. We observe a pattern that the rightmost number in each group is the product of the other two numbers. We ask about the value of the number 5. When we ask about the value of the number 5, we respond that the value of 5 is 2. Therefore, there is a 2-symbol icon in the right corner of the group with the number 5. There is a jigsaw icon in the left corner of each group of numbers. The number 2 in the group with the jigsaw icon and the number 18 in the group with the triangle icon indicates that the rightmost number in each group should be the product of the other two numbers.

There is a triangle arrangement of numbers in the groups. We observe that the numbers in the triangle arrangement are related to each other. The rightmost number in each group is the product of the other two numbers. For example, the rightmost number 9 in the group [6, 9, 54] is the product of 6 and 9.
