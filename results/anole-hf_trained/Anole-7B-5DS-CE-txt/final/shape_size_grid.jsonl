Therefore, we can improve the algorithm by having a pattern-based approach in addition to an-based approach. Based on the pattern in the colors of the rectangles, we can improve the algorithm as follows:\n\n- If there is a pattern in the color and size of the rectangles, then we should ask a question about the pattern.

So, the correctness of the pattern and the final answer is based on the symbol and the color of the rectangles. There is a mistake in one of the patterns. What is the missing rectangle with the wrong color? Look at the pattern of rectangles with star symbols and the color of those rectangles. The pattern is that the rectangles with a star symbol have a color that is the color of the star symbol. For example, the rectangle with a star and a green color is green in color. The rectangle with a 2 and a red color is red in color. There is a star symbol with a red color. According to the pattern, the rectangle with a 2 and a red color should be red in color. However, we see that that rectangle is white in color. There is a mistake in the pattern of the rectangles with star symbols and colors. The mistake is in the color of the rectangle with a 2 star. The rectangle with a 2 star should be red in color, not white in color. Based on the correct pattern, the rest of the rectangles should be green in color. Therefore, a new set of rectangles with the correct color and star symbol should be: . According to this new set of rectangles with the correct color and star symbol, the rectangle with a 2 star should be red in color, the rectangle with a 1 star should be green in color, the rectangle with a 3 star should be green in color, the rectangle with a 4 star should be blue in color, and the rectangle with a 6 star should be blue in color. Finally, the mistake in the pattern of the old rectangles is that the rectangle with a 2 star should be red in color, not white in color. Therefore, the story behind the rectangles with different colors and star symbols is that there was a certain color-star symbol and a certain color-star symbol pattern. The rectangles with the same color and star symbol followed the color-star symbol pattern and had the same color and star symbol. However, there was a mistake in the pattern of the rectangles. The rectangle with a 2 star should be red in color, not white in color.

Therefore, based on the pattern that the color of the shape corresponds to its size, the question 'What is the color of the shape with the large size?' should be: 'What is the color of the shape with the large size?'. The answer is 'yellow'. Among the 7 rectangles with different colors and shapes, the rectangles with the green color are the 'green' shapes. There are 3 green shapes. Among the 3 green shapes, the other two green shapes are the pattern. Therefore, the final pattern is: 'green' (green), 'red' (red), and 'yellow' (yellow). Finally, among the 7 rectangles with different colors and shapes, the final pattern is: 'green' (green), 'red' (red), 'yellow' (yellow), and small. The question 'What is the color of the shape with the large size?' means what is the color of the shape with the large size.

Amongst the remaining 6 icons, there is a pattern of green triangle with green side and blue triangle with blue side. Finally, among the 'green triangles, there is a pattern of green side and 'green side. Therefore, based on the pattern of (-) and (green), the icon with a 1-sided body and a green side should be the final pattern. However, according to the pattern of 7-1, the icon with a 7-sided body should be the final pattern. To reconcile the two patterns, we-shaped icon with a '-' side and a 7-sided body.
