Hence, the pattern is that the color of each rectangle corresponds to its length.\n\n# Option A\nReplacing '?' with purple: \nReasoning: Comparing the color of each rectangle to its length, it does not fit the observed color-length pattern. purple is unlikely to be the correct answer.\n\n# Option B\nReplacing '?' with red: \nReasoning: Comparing the color of each rectangle to its length, it does not fit the observed color-length pattern. red is unlikely to be the correct answer.\n\n# Option C\nReplacing '?' with green: \nReasoning: Comparing the color of each rectangle to its length, it does not fit the observed color-length pattern. green is unlikely to be the correct answer.\n\n# Option D\nReplacing '?' with blue: \nReasoning: Comparing the color of each rectangle to its length, it matches well the color-length pattern. blue is a strong candidate for the correct answer.\n\n# Final Answer:\nBased on the reasoning process, the best fit for the missing number is blue. The pattern that the color of each rectangle corresponds to its length holds consistently when we replace '?' with blue.
